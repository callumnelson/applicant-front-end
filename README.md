**In The Arena** was developed due to the increasing concern over the mounting stress on society, impacting mental health, and resulting in two trends. First, many approaches are being developed to address these issues, but it's difficult to compare which is best and for whom. Second, there are paywalls in many apps that may discourage users from accessing helpful tools. Recognizing the fight for mental health is real and that we all need all the help we can get, **In The Arena** aims to help by equipping individuals with the right tools for the job. 

**In The Arena** is an open-source app that allows individuals to contribute the tools they have found to be the most impactful and discover more tools that have helped others.
